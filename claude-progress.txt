## Session Log

### Session 2 — 2026-02-09 (Long-running implementation)
- Fixed: 10 test failures from previous session
  - 6 metadata tests: moved `import mutagen` to module level in analysis/metadata.py
  - 4 scoring boundary tests: added _EPS=1e-9 float tolerance in graph/scoring.py
- Implemented: Phase 4 — Graph Engine Core
  - GRAPH-001: TrackGraph class (NetworkX DiGraph wrapper) in graph/graph.py
  - GRAPH-002: Edge computation with threshold filtering + incremental computation
  - GRAPH-006: DBSCAN clustering with 7D feature vectors, auto-labeling in graph/clustering.py
  - GRAPH-007: Force-directed layout (spring_layout) in graph/layout.py
  - GRAPH-008: Scatter map layout (t-SNE projection) in graph/layout.py
  - GRAPH-009: Greedy nearest-neighbor pathfinding in graph/pathfinding.py
  - GRAPH-010: 2-opt improvement for set ordering in graph/pathfinding.py
- Implemented: Phase 5 — Suggestion Engine
  - SUG-001: SuggestionEngine with full pipeline in suggestions/engine.py
  - SUG-002: Sequence-aware suggestions (context modifier)
  - SUG-003: Harmonic Flow strategy (default, modifier=1.0)
  - SUG-004: Energy Arc strategy (target energy by set position)
  - SUG-005: Discovery strategy (boost rarely-used tracks)
  - SUG-006: Groove Lock strategy (same groove 1.2x, different 0.6x)
  - SUG-007: Contrast strategy (reward energy/frequency differences)
  - SUG-008: BPM Range filter
  - SUG-009: Key Lock filter (harmonic_score >= 0.4)
  - SUG-010: Diversity bonus (cluster diversity)
  - SUG-011: Weight customization (via SuggestionConfig)
- Implemented: Export Layer
  - EXP-001: M3U export with EXTINF metadata in export/m3u.py
  - EXP-002: Rekordbox XML export with DJ_PLAYLISTS format in export/rekordbox.py
  - EXP-003: CSV export with all 24 analysis columns in export/csv.py
  - EXP-004: Save/Load via GraphState JSON serialization (Pydantic model_dump_json)
  - Shared utilities in export/playlist.py (resolve_tracks, format_duration)
- Tests written:
  - test_clustering.py: 20 tests (feature vectors, DBSCAN, labeling, cluster objects)
  - test_pathfinding.py: 21 tests (greedy, 2-opt, optimal_order, total_compatibility)
  - test_suggestions.py: 44 tests (strategies, filters, context modifier, diversity, engine)
  - test_export.py: 36 tests (M3U, Rekordbox XML, CSV, GraphState round-trip)
- All tests: 457 passed in 4.54s
- Features marked passing: 32/62 (was 10/62)
- Next suggested: Phase 6 — Desktop UI Shell (UI-001+)
